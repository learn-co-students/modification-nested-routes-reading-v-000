Notes for form. Post_controller class underneath.

#_form.html.erb

<%= form_for(@post) do |f| %>
  <label>Post title:</label><br>
  <% if @post.author.nil? %>
    <%= f.select :author_id, options_from_collection_for_select(Author.all, :id, :name) %><br>
  <% end %>

  That gives us a select control if we don't have an author, but we have a problem. We can only have one :author_id field. We could put that hidden_field in an else, which would work, but then we would have a whole bunch of logic cluttering up our view. So let's dump it in our posts_helper and clean up that form.
  
  <%= f.hidden_field :author_id %>

  We set it up in the new action, but it never made it to the view so that it could get submitted back to the server. Let's fix that.

  <%= f.text_field :title %><br>

  <label>Post Description</label><br>
  <%= f.text_area :description %><br>

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>

changed to

We don't have to change any views because new and edit both use the same _form partial that already has the author_id.
Now we need to update our post show view to give us the new nested link to edit the post for the author.

    #  We'll actually be carrying this id with us for the next few steps, babysitting it through the server request/response cycle.
    #so this was added instead.
